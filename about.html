									<h1>About Me<br />
									</h1>
									<p>Business administration bachelor currently working in Macau as a law firm manager, with previous experience working at an 
										architect and engineering consultancy company, firstly as a financial accountant and afterward as a 
										project controller and business analyst..</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/macau.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I arrived in Macau in May 2018 to work at local group CESL Asia as a financial accountant for one of the group's subsidiaries MPS - Macau Professional Services.
								For 3 years, I did all the accounting tasks for a company averaging USD 10M in yearly revenue with a headcount of over 100 staff, mostly composed of engineers or architects.
								As a financial accountant, I understood how important it is to be organized and thorough, especially regarding supporting documents for the accounting entries that I made.
								I also realized that to provide accurate reports, I would have to put extra effort into gathering information from operations to book accruals in the right periods,
								which eventually led me to dig into all project contracts, which enabled me to provide very accurate revenue and cost (manpower) forecasts that both the operations and finance teams could rely on.</p>
								<p>This and relevant changes at the top of the company, 3 Executive Directors left in less than 1 year, made the newly appointed Principal Director entrust me as a Project Controller / 
								Business Analyst. With more time to focus on operations, I was able to create Excel tables that included the information of hundreds of project contracts and create a data model
								that connected these tables to the MS SQL Server finance ERP (Microsoft Dynamics) and also the internally developed HR ERP that provided the time allocation by project (costs),
								allowing for timely billing, technical and regulatory (licensing) follow-up, accounts receivable follow-up, budget and timeline variance review, and actual status reporting at a glance, 
								through a Power BI dashboard that was used as the background for a monthly progress meeting conducted by the Principal Director, me, and the Project Manager.
								As I was able to understand the business requirements of project directors and managers, I was also working closely with the group's Executive Director for IT and Operations in developing
								the internally created HR ERP.</p>
								<p>Looking for a new challenge, that coincided with the end of the COVID pandemic, I took the role I am currently in, Manager at Manuela Antonio Law Firm, one of Macau's most well-known
								law firms. The main goal was to continue developing my operational control skills and add skills I didn't have in other business units such as Marketing, IT, and HR. As part of this position,
								I see every single e-mail that comes in or out of the firm's mailbox, effectively knowing the status of most of the work in progress and making sure deadlines are kept and invoices are 
								sent on time. Leading the Marketing and Business Development initiatives, I was able to optimize the website with an investment of just USD 100, increasing the monthly traffic to three times
								what it had been, opening 2 recurring business segments by suggesting and adjusting content by analyzing Google search engine data. By leading the IT initiatives, the firm transitioned to
								the Microsoft 365 environment, keeping the main working tool (Outlook) working uninterrupted, enabling cloud backup of data (crucial to avoid data loss from old computers), and facilitating
								work from home necessities. Also in IT, I developed from scratch the firm's IT Policies documentation including Change Management, Risk Management, and Vendor Selection policies, as well
								as Cybersecurity training materials for the staff. This was particularly important because the lack of these documents and procedures kept the firm away from major financial institution's legal
								panels, which was hitting the firm financially. All in all, the firm's dependency on a below-par IT services provider was mitigated and relied upon for only minor issues. Finally, regarding HR,
								I am responsible for recruitment, interviewing, onboarding, annual leave planning, payroll, and development of internal policies and procedures including career development for trainee lawyers.</p>
